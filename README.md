# Code School

This repos is where the MES team will document how we are organizing ourselves.
Once the project Code School(CS) is under development by the LAPPIS organization
it didn't look good for us to put our internal organization into the main repo.

It this repo we going to add:

- Product and Team backlog
- Issue tracking
- Zenhub documentation(boards)

For sanity will also are going to put what we current working on in the LAPPIS repos/Main repo.
